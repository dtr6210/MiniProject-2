# MiniProject-2 Reactify

Description:
The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules.

We have covered React in Modules 6 and at the start of 7.  Incorporate these skills into a mini project that you'd be proud to show off on your portfolio!  Use the existing work you have and convert it to React -OR- create a new mini project!

Consider a topic you feel strongly interested in, a hobby, an issue at work.  This could be in addition to your Capstone project.

Prepare and present a 10-minute presentation in class to get practice demonstrating and speaking about your work.

NOTE: Presentation is required so we can 1). Ensure you get practice, and 2.) Grade your work

What to do:
Create Application Flow (Simple: landing page, login page, dashboard) <-- Write notes here first! Why are you doing it?
Generate a LoFi Figma
Code it up React Components/Structure (Three pages: landing, sign up/login, and dashboard are minimum)
Stretch Goal 1: HiFi Figma
Stretch Goal 2: Use design framework like Material UI
Stretch Goal 3: Add more pages, flesh out your app more (3 pages minimum)
Stretch Goal 4: Use axios or fetch to get data from third party API (research free apis that are relevant to your app)
Stretch Goal 5: Use BrowserRouting (discussed in late Module 7 slides) to connect pages (landing -> login -> dashboard)
